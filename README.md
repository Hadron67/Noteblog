# Noteblog
This is my new blog and a static blog generator. I'm previously using Hexo and switched to Jekyll, but Jekyll still not appeals to me much so I end up writing one myself.

The philosophy of my generator is to do as less as possible and leave most configuration works to the user, so it may not fit most people's need. Further more, it is plugin-based.
