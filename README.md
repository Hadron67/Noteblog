# Noteblog
This is my new blog and a static blog generator. I'm previously using Hexo and switched to Jekyll, but Jekyll still not appeals to me much so I end up writing one myself.

The philosophy of my generator is to do as less as possible and leave most configuration works to the user, so it may not fit most people's need. Further more, it is plugin-based.

## Credits
Styles are inspired from these following blog themes or sites:
* Hexo theme [Landscape Plus](https://github.com/xiangming/landscape-plus), which is the theme of my old blog;
* Jekyll theme [Jacman](https://github.com/Simpleyyt/jekyll-jacman);
* The style of level 2 headings in the posts is inspired from another Jekyll theme on [jekylltheme.org](http://jekyllthemes.org), but I couldn't find it now.
* The purple strip on top of each post entry was inspired from [chorer](https://chorer.github.io).
* Hexo theme [indigo](https://github.com/yscoder/hexo-theme-indigo).
